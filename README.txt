This project focuses on building a terminal based, online bookstore.
In this project, I showcase my software development skills using Python programming language. I demonstrate the application of Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation tasks. The project includes scripts and notebooks illustrating various data processing techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms implemented in Python for solving real-world business problems.

About Me

I have a deep passion for technology, having grown up with a constant drive to learn the ins-and-outs of any piece of software I came across. Starting with the Adobe suite while studying media, learning music production software such as Ableton Live in my spare time, and more recently, Business Inteligence tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and SQL.

I gained an insight into the world of analytics in a previous role where a piece of data analytics work that I completed (training needs analysis), led to a huge increase in efficiency across my team and the project.

This gave me a massively rewarding feeling and made me curious about the real positive impact that effective analytics can have. Following that curiosity led me to learning SQL and Tableau in my spare time using online resources, and recently landed me on an intensive Data and Business Analytics training course and internship, covering both of those topics, and many more in great depth.

Having gained confidence in those skills, I am now pursuing roles in Analytics, and believe that I would thrive in an analytics position that supports my growth as an Early-in-Career professional.
